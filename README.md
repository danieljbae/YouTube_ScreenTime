# YouTube_ScreenTime

With this project I aimed to answer 2 questions: 
- What type of videos do I watch? 
- When do I watch said categories? 

Inspired by iPhone's screentime and the recent documentary "The Social Dilemna", which underscores the rapid increase of usage in technology.

Using [Google's Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) service, I was able to export my watched videos and timestamps. And used the YouTube API to pull data such as video category.
